# crestron-command-finder

A program that makes finding the right Crestron console command a little bit easier.

# Command Database

The command database currently consists of the commands that appear in response to `help all` on devices in my personal test environment.

The hope for the future is to include undocumented commands, commands for devices not in my test environment, and other additional resources. Check the issues tab for details.

# Contribute

I hope to soon have an information tool script you can run against your own devices to contribute commands to the database
